### Steps
- This is the folder where you will create an about you.  You will create a new folder and name it your name.  Then add a file in that folder called: FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.md
    - ".md" stands for MarkDown.  You can use the markdown cheat sheet provided in the root directory to spruce up your AboutMe!
